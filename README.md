# The porridgebowl
A weighted random opening generator for Go.

I always thought most openings were really really boring, so I made this. It gives 3 or 4 random moves with a minimum distance between them. The higher the minimum distance, the more it skews towards the corner; the lower the distance, the more it allows centre moves.
