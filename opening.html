	<p>Welcome to the porridge bowl, a weighted random go opening generator. It gives 3 or 4 random moves, weighted towards the corners; 3rd line is more likely than 4th, 4th more likely than 5th, etc. It will never give first or second line moves.</p>

	<p>You can set how hard it skews towards the corner (the higher the skew, the less it allows centre moves):</p>
