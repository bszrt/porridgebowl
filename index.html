	<p>Welcome to the porridge bowl, a weighted random opening generator. It's meant to give somewhat playable openings, so it's weighted towards the corners. 3rd line is more likely than 4th, 4th more likely than 5th, etc. It will never give first or second line moves. Click the button to get a new one:</p>
